# Cancer-SVM-
Cancer dataset classified using Support vector machine. Python code 

The dataset is to be downloaded online and then switched to a data frame format using the Pandas library.

The ID field contains the patient identifiers. The characteristics of the cell samples from each patient are contained in fields Clump to Mit. The values are graded from 1 to 10, with 1 being the closest to benign.
The Class field contains the diagnosis, as confirmed by separate medical procedures, as to whether the samples are benign (value = 2) or malignant (value = 4).

The classification output is visualized with a confusion matrix, and the model evaluation is assessed through Jaccard and f1 indices.
